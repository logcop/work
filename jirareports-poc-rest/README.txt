This is a proof of concept to test the Jira REST API version 2. 

Where I left off:
	Created RestClientApiPOC - This is not working and not a good way forward. It was for the jira REST client API in Java. 
	There is very little documentation and different versions. Limited support. It appears the Rest API version 2 is the way forward.
	
	Created RestClient2Poc - This is the proof of concept for the Rest API version 2. The API is just a list of urls that can be called to return json.
								I have tested the API by logging into Jira in a web browser and testing the rest urls. They work. Started working on the
								Proof of Concept. It is not working yet.
